In today's fast-paced and diverse learning environments, it can be challenging for individuals to find study partners who align with their schedules, academic backgrounds, and learning interests. This project aims to address this challenge by building an intelligent session-matching system that groups users into study groups based on shared characteristics such as availability, skill level, geographic location, and topics of interest.

The system leverages **K-Means clustering**, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, to group users based on similarities in their profiles. The dataset includes user attributes like daily and hourly availability, proficiency levels, geographic location, and topics of interest, which are preprocessed, normalized, and used to train the model. The optimal number of clusters (`k`) is determined using the **Elbow Method** and validated through the **Silhouette Score**, ensuring well-defined groupings.

Once clustered, users within the same group are expected to have similar learning needs and schedules, fostering better collaboration and engagement during study sessions. The modelâ€™s effectiveness is evaluated by checking within-cluster variance and visualizing the clusters using **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**.

This project serves as a proof-of-concept for developing intelligent session-matching systems, which can be scaled and extended to real-world learning communities to enhance knowledge-sharing and peer collaboration. Future work includes refining the model by incorporating additional features such as learning preferences, improving cluster interpretability, and testing with real-world data.
